            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As an enthusiastic and driven individual, I am dedicated to leveraging my technical expertise in Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, and IoT to propel organizational growth and innovation. My passion lies in the realms of data engineering, machine learning, deep learning, and AIoT, where I continuously seek to tackle complex coding challenges and develop cutting-edge tech solutions. My projects, including the Smart NICU for Neonates and Smart Home Automation System, reflect my ability to integrate advanced technologies such as YOLOV8 pose detection and AIoT systems to solve real-world problems.

I have had the honor of being a finalist at prestigious events like IIT PALS Innowah 2024 and Mistral Hackfest 2023, and participating in the Smart India Hackathon. These experiences have honed my problem-solving, critical thinking, and leadership skills, enabling me to thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and adaptable team player, with certifications from leading institutions such as Dataiku, CISCO, and NVIDIA, complementing my practical experience gained during internships and various projects.

Outside of my technical pursuits, I am a sports and fitness enthusiast, having captained the National and State Football teams, and actively participate in marathons and long-distance running events. My hobbies also include gaming, reading books, and exploring new technologies.

I am excited to connect with professionals and organizations that share my passion for technology and innovation, and to contribute to impactful projects that drive progress and transformation.</p>
